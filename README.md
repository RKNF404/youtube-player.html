To quickly summarize what this is, it's essentially a super minimal youtube client. You get a Youtube link, paste it in the box, press play and enjoy.

My web dev skill are kinda jank so expect the visuals to be... yeah.

## Features

(You expect too much if you think this can do anything too advanced)
- Play Videos (but not all, due to Youtube's anti-piracy some videos are unavailable to embedders, this is mainly just commercial stuff like officially posted music)
- Future Proof (unlike most Youtube clients, this works exactly how Youtube intends it to, so as long as Youtube allows arbitrary embedders this will work)
- Playlists (Youtube supports embedded playlists as well, which can be dropped in the playbar, you can even play from a specific position in said playlist while still retaining the context of being in a playlist)
- Blocks Ads... Kinda (there is a bit of a way to block ads through this webapp... but idk if Youtube will try to crack down on it if I explain here)
